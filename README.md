# Web Portfolio — [Avishka Hashara]

Welcome to my personal web portfolio! 🌐  
Built with React + Vite, this is a showcase of the projects, skills, and creative works I want to share.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `public/` — static files (favicon, assets, etc.)  
- `src/` — main React code (components, utilities, etc.)  
- `index.html` — web page entry point  
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json` — dependency management and scripts  
- `vite.config.js` — Vite build and dev server configuration  
- `eslint.config.js` — linting rules to keep the code clean and consistent  

## ✨ Key Features

- Built with **React + Vite** — lightweight, fast reload, and optimal build performance.  
- **ESLint** configured to ensure a clean and organized coding style.  
- Modular structure ready for expansion—easy to add "About", "Projects", and other pages.
